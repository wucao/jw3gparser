===============================================================================
1.0 Introduction
===============================================================================

This document describes the format of the actions found in the TimeSlot blocks
of the replay (see 'w3g_format.txt' section 5 for details):

0x1F       - TimeSlot block (rarely also 0x1E)
  1 word   - number of bytes that follow
  1 word   - time increment (milliseconds)
              about 250 ms in battle.net
              about 100 ms in LAN and single player
  n-2 byte - CommandData block(s) (not present if n=2)

For every player which has executed an action during the last time slot there
is at least one 'CommandData' block.

CommandData block:
  1 byte  - PlayerID
  1 word  - Action block length
  n byte  - Action block(s) (may contain multiple actions !)

Action block:
  1 byte  - ActionID (see 2.0)
  n byte  - action arguments (see 2.0)

Notes:
  o The number of 'Action blocks' can only be determined by parsing the actions
    up to the denoted Action block length.
  o The 'time increments' are only correct for replays played at fastest speed.
  o Accumulate all 'time increments' to get the time of current action(s).

TODO: analyse time increments of slow/normal speed


===============================================================================
1.1 Standardized APMs
===============================================================================

This section defines a standardized Actions-Per-Minute(APM) value.
With it we hope to make APM values more comparable inbetween all current and
future replay tools out there and coming. Please use it in your tool too :D

The main goal is an easy-to-implement algorithm. This way even simple replay
tools should have no difficulties at all to calculate it.

Basic rules:
 o Only count in-game actions (no map-signals, no chat).
 o Every counted action increments the player action counter by one.
 o Do not filter out any player action.
 o APM = numbers of actions of a player / time this player played.

Accordingly all actions in section 2.0 are marked in the headline:
 [APM+] = Action is counted.
 [APM?] = Special, please read the notes on this action (0x16, 0x19).
 [APM-] = Action is not counted.

Additionally you have to pay attention to the pause/unpause actions in order to
determine the played time correctly:
 Pause game (action 0x01):
   o Stop the time at the first occurence of this action
     (there might be multiple ones).
   o The pause action itself is not counted.
   o Do NOT stop counting the actions within a pause
     (but skip actions like map signals as usual).
 Resume game (action 0x02):
   o Resume counting the time at first occurence of this action
     (there might be multiple ones).
   o Do not count this action itself.

Due to this simple method there are the following inadequacies:
 o Cancelling a unit/building by pressing Escape key will be counted twice
   (Action 0x61 + Action 0x10 with unitid=0x08000D00).
 o Map signal are uncounted. They are no real in-game actions and can very
   easily abused to increase the APM value.
 o No 'tab' action are counted (since patch 1.14b).
   (Prior to patch 1.14b only the last action of a complete cycle through all
    subgroups was not counted.)

Keep in mind that for the APM value it is not important, which consequences
within the game an action has. It is only significant *how often* it is used.
If a player executes a specific action once every minute, it only results in
a 1 APM difference at the end.
Do you really need a APM precision better than say ±5 APMs ?

Note:
 o If you decide to develop your own APM system (e.g. by filtering some user
   actions) please do *not* call it APM.
   Call it TrueAPM, RealAPM, myAPM, UserAPM or something like that instead.

 Notes:
  o Due to lag there can be multiple pause or unpause actions, but they didn't
    stack. The first unpause will resume the game, no matter how many pause
    actions came before.

  o There can be other actions between pause and resume action
    (e.g. map signal action, actions issued before game pausing but delayed
    by network latency)

  o The length of the replay (found in replay header) is the effective play
    time excluding any pause

0x16 - Change Selection (Unit, Building, Area)           [ 4+n*8 bytes ] [APM?]
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 1 byte  - select mode:
            0x01 - add to selection      (select)
            0x02 - remove from selection (deselect)
 1 word  - number (n) of units/buildings

 block repeated n times:
   1 dword - ObjectID1
   1 dword - ObjectID2

  (ObjectID1 == ObjectID2 for starting town hall and trees ?)

 Note:
  o If one simply selects a new unit then this results in a single 'add to
    selection'-action (16 01) preceded by a 'remove from selection'-action
    (16 02) for the complete old selection.

 APM-Note:
  o Every 'Change Selection' action (both 'select' and 'deselect') increases
    the APM counter by one [APM+], BUT:
  o Do *not* count a 'select' action that follows *immediately* after a
    'deselect' action within the *same* CommandData block.
    This is reasonable because mostly all deselect actions in front of select
    actions are autogenerated by WarCraft and therefore the whole deselect/
    select combo action needs to be counted as 1 action only.
  o Example pseudo algorithm:

      FOREACH TimeSlot-block DO
        ...

        FOREACH CommandData-block DO
          id = ReadPlayerID()
          LastActionWasDeselect = FALSE;
          ...

          FOREACH Action-block DO
            actionid = ReadActionID()
            ...

 Notes:
  o Always following a 0x1A-Action (Pre subselection)

  o The ItemID and the ObjectID represents the first unit in the newly
    selected subgroup.
    This can be used to associate ItemID's with ObjectID's for one unit!

  o Nearly all 'Select Subgroup' actions are autogenerated.

 1 byte  - subgroup number (0-11, 0xFF)

 Notes:
  o There is a special subgroup action: 0x19 0xFF
    It is an auto-generated action in the replay and might mean something
    like "update subgroups" (e.g. when a summoned unit disappears or peasant
    turns into militia etc.).

  o Most 'select subgroup 0'-actions (0x19 00) are autogenerated too (e.g. if
    one selects a subgroup and then selects a completely different unit).

  o Since patch 1.13 nearly all 'Select Subgroup' actions are autogenerated.
    Very often WarCraft seems to write a complete subgroup status to the replay.
    For every player there is an 'Update Subgroup' action (0x19 0xFF)
    followed immediately by a 'Select Subgroup' action where the subgroup
    number represents the current subgroup status. This status does not always
    correspond to the currently selected subgroup of this player. (TODO: why?)

 APM-Note:
  o Only count this action if 'subgroup number' is neither 0x00 nor 0xFF.

  o Do *not* count a 'Select Subgroup' action that follows *immediately* after
    a 'Update Subgroup' action within the *same* CommandData block.
    (Adapt the example pseudo algorithm of action 0x16.)

    "61 10 40 08 00 0D 00 ..." action sequence.

  o This action is normally preceded by a deselect (0x16 02) and subgroup

===============================================================================
3.0 AbilityFlags
===============================================================================

Ability flags represent additional attributes of an action.
E.g.: If bit 0 is set the action was queued (by pressing the shift key) and
      will only be executed after the previous action was finished.

Unfortunately Warcraft sets some of the bits automatically, even when the
player didn't press a modifier button/key (e.g. subgroup command flag).

The Flag item used to have BYTE size until patch 1.12. With patch 1.13 it
was extended to a WORD.
Flag value is composed of the following values

  0x0001 - queue command (shift held down)
  0x0002 - ? (apply to all units in subgroup ?)
  0x0004 - ? (area effect ?)
  0x0008 - group command (all units in current selection)
  0x0010 - move group without formation (formation disabled)
  0x0020 - ?
  0x0040 - ctrl held down (subgroup command)
         sometimes automatically added
         (e.g. subgroup worker -> rightclick mine without ctrl)

 new since patch 1.13
  0x0100 - autocast on/off command


Examples:
  0x42 - rightclick item in inventory
  0x44 - use ability (revive hero, cast spell)
  0x48 - ctrl group command (group peasants -> goldmine)

  0x44 - detonate Wisp (area effect unit ability ?)
  0x4C - use WON (area effect item ?)
  0x00 - use ability (Stop, Hold, uproot, Mirrorimage etc.)
  0x40 - Train unit / Research / Buy (resources changed?)
         (Orc burrow - combatpositions)
  0x42 - use special ability (that changes unit stats ???)
         (heros: skill ability, HU townhall: call to arms)
  0x44 - Summon (summon units and train heros)

TODO: further research, verification


===============================================================================
4.0 ItemID's
===============================================================================

There are two types of ItemID's - alphanumeric and stringencoded:
 o Both types are 4 Bytes long.
 o Stringencoded ID's contain four valid characters.
 o Alphanumeric ID's have always the format: ?? ?? 0D 00


===============================================================================
4.1 Stringencoded ItemID's
===============================================================================

Stringencoded ItemID's are used for:
 o Constructing a building
 o Upgrading a building (Tier2, Tier3, tower upgrades)
 o Training units/heros
 o Skilling hero abilities
 o Researching abilities/skills/spells
 o Researching upgrades
 o Buying items/merc./heros

Stringencoded ID's contain four valid characters, giving a representative name
for the unit/hero/item/ability.

Blizzard used some kind of naming convention for some things:
The lowbyte (little Endian style) of the string may mean:
     'A' - Hero ability

     'e' - Night Elf unit
     'E' - Night Elf hero

     'h' - Human unit
     'H' - Human hero

     'o' - Orc unit
     'O' - Orc hero

     'R' - Research item

     'u' - Undead unit
     'U' - Undead hero

For Hero abilities ('A') the next byte denotes the race (E=elf,H=human,O=orc,U=undead).
For Research items ('R') the next byte denotes the race (e=elf,h=human,o=orc,u=undead).

Shop items and mercenaries don't fit into this naming sceme - e.g. some things
start with a 'h'. But the hole string is always unequivocal.

A complete list of string encoded ID's used can be found in the file
  "war3.mpq/Scripts/common.ai"    (units & buildings)
and in the files
  "war3.mpq/Units/*Strings.txt"   (units, abilities, upgrades, items)
in your WarCraft directory.

Even more information (including gold cost etc.) about the String ID's can be found
in the "war3.mpq/Units/*.slk" data files.

Following are some example ID's:

             ewsp - Elf Wisp
             esen - Elf Huntress (Sentinel?)
             etoa - Elf tree of ages (tier2)

The following abilities are present in the world editor but cannot be used
in the game (and therefore the ItemID remains unknown):

    - Tank Load Pilot (HU) (game crashes)
    - Tank Drop Pilot (HU) (Msg: "no pilot present")
    - Pilot Tank (HU)      (Msg: "unit not a tank")

    - Gold2Lumber Exchange (disabled)
    - Lumber2Gold Exchange (disabled)


===============================================================================
5.0 Object ID's
===============================================================================

Every single object (units, heros, items, buildings, summons, even trees) in a
replay gets a unique number, the ObjectID. It is used as a reference to this
object in 'change selection' actions or for denoting target objects.
Warcraft generates the number probably just-in-time and (more or less)
upcounting.

One ObjectID consists of two doubleword numbers. Sometimes these numbers are
equal (probably for all objects that exist at the start of the game).

Notes:
 o ObjectIDs are still an unsolved problem in replays.
   (And will maybe never be solved in a usable way.
    Maybe the new action 0x1A introduced with patch 1.14b can be used to get
    some usable information out of the ObjectID's.)


Differenz der ObjectID1 der Startarbeiter:
 Peasant: 0x16

6.0 Click Coordinates
===============================================================================

 Click coordinates are standard IEEE single precision floats (4 bytes)
 corresponding to the coordinates in World Editor.

 Notes:
  o The center of the map has the coordinates (0,0).
    //FIXME: its rather the center of map coordinate range

  o The range of the coordinates depends on the size of the map and the
    equivalent settings in the World Editor.

  o Maximum range is -16384.000 to 16384.000 (256x256 maps).

  o Buildings can only be placed on a discrete grid.
    The grid step size is 64.00 Units per grid line.


===============================================================================
7.0 General notes
===============================================================================
 o Patch 1.07 represents the retail version of the expansion pack
   'The Frozen Throne' (TFT). It was immediatlely followed by a patch 1.10 that
   brought both TFT and ROC to the same patch level. Actually both game
   versions seem to use the improved TFT game engine.

 o There are only user inputs in a replay. There are no computer actions, no
   'training complete' data, no results of fights, no information about death
    of units, etc..

 o Most actions in the replay are right-click actions. The true actions they
   are translated to by the game remain hidden.

 o There are no special actions for build, skill, train etc.
   There are only five basic actions for this task (0x10 - 0x14) that
   differ in the number of arguments provided.
   The true nature of the action is only detectable by the provided ItemID.

 o Build actions that failed due to unsufficient resources are not saved
   in the replay !

 o There is no difference regarding action codes between a train action for a
   single building and a train action for two or more buildings.
   One cannot determine whether a unit is build in all of the selected
   buildings or only in one. It depends on resources and food supply but is
   not denoted in the replay.

 o There are no notifications in the replay, if a player overrides a command
   before it was executed (e.g. by giving the unit a new order while it is on
   the way to execute an ability at a distant location/target).
   Therefore for all actions 0x11-0x14 one cannot be sure whether the assigned
   action was really executed.

 o Changing map colors (friend/foe) is not recorded in replay.

 o Selecting already selected units gives no additional actions in the replay!

 o Day/night changes are not denoted in the replay data.

 o Any field of view changes (e.g. click on minimap, 'space', 'ctrl-c')
   are not saved in the replay.

 o In replays of patch version <= 1.06 only chat messages that activate
   map triggers are saved (action 0x60).


===============================================================================
8.0 Notes on older Patches
===============================================================================
Pre Patch 1.14b:
 o Action 0x19 was used instead of action 0x1A.
 o Action 0x1B - 0x1E were shifted down by one (0x1A - 0x1D).

Pre patch 1.13:
 o AbilityFlag (action 0x10-0x14) was only a byte, instead of a word.
 o Actions 0x10 - 0x14 were 1 byte shorter.

Pre patch 1.07:
 o Chat text messages were not saved
 o Actions 0x10 - 0x14 were 8 bytes shorter.
 o Actions 0x62 used to be 4 bytes shorter.
 o There was *one* action missing between 0x63 and 0x65 (the specific action
   is still unknown). So all following actions were shifted by one.

Pre patch 1.03:
 o (TODO)

Frozen Throne Beta Replays:
 o (not investigated)
